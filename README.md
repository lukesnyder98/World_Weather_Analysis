# World_Weather_Analysis

In this project, we created an app that allows users to create their own travel itinerary. They can filter locations by weather preferences, retrieve a list of potential destinations, and then choose four cities to create their itinerary. Using the Google Maps Directions API, the app then maps out a route between the four cities and adds a marker layer to the map.
